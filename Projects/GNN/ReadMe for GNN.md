# Graph Neural Networks
## Progress
While going towards the last task learnt a lot about graphs in general and studied various courses, watched Antonio Longa's tutorials. MessagePassing was a key learning I would say.

## Literature Review 

## Coding a GAT
Firstly coded a GAT by directly importing it in the forward prop function! Was not allowed clearly.

Started coding it without importing the GNN.  Found a lot of difficulties in finding the right message to pass and how to multiply the Wh and the attention matrices.
